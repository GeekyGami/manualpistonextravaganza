# Manual Piston Extravaganza

## What this mod does:
It hooks anything that is animated by either an animator or a videoclip,
and it makes its speed dependent on the speed of the mouse.
The goal is to replicate the gameplay and behavior of @HomeMate's penetration mechanic in any game that has animations.

To activate function, press the numpad "/" key.

Then wiggle your mouse around. The faster you move the mouse, the faster you penetrate, ideally.

### This mod will need your game to be hooked with Bepinex.
### The root of this archive goes in the root directory of your game, where you can see game_data, and its exe.


## Compilation instructions:
Load it as a project in VS Studio.
Build.

There may be other ways, but I am not exactly a developer.
Don't @ me.
