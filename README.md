# Manual Piston Extravaganza

## What this mod does:
It hooks anything that is animated by either an animator or a videoclip,
and it makes its speed dependent on the speed of the mouse.
The goal is to replicate the gameplay and behavior of @HomeMate's penetration mechanic in any game that has animations.

To activate function, press the numpad "/" key.

Then wiggle your mouse around. The faster you move the mouse, the faster you penetrate, ideally.

### This mod will need your game to be hooked with Bepinex.
### The root of this archive goes in the root directory of your game, where you can see game_data, and its exe.


## Compilation instructions:
Load it as a project in VS Studio.
Build.

There may be other ways, but I am not exactly a developer.
Don't @ me.


Big thanks to Lost Robot from the LMMS server and Essu from the IllusionSoft Discord for helping with the code!
While I'm certain it's not done to the standard of either of them for many reasons, it is much, MUCH better than it would have been without them.
Thank you!
