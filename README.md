Manual Piston Extravaganza

What this mod does:
It hooks anything that is animated by either an animator or a videoclip,
and it makes its speed dependent on the speed of the mouse.
The goal is to replicate the gameplay and behavior of @HomeMate's penetration mechanic in any game that has animations.

To activate function, press the numpad "/" key.

Then wiggle your mouse around. The faster you move the mouse, the faster you penetrate, ideally.

This mod will need your game to be hooked with Bepinex.
The root of this archive goes in the root directory of your game, where you can see game_data, and its exe.


Compilation instructions:
Load it as a project in VS Studio.
Build.

There may be other ways, but I am not exactly a developer.
Don't @ me.
